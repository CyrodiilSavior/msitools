wixl
====

A wiX-like tool, that builds Windows Installer (MSI) packages from an XML document.

Wixl will try to share the same syntax as the WiX toolset, http://wixtoolset.org/

The major advantage of Wixl is that it doesn't require .NET, nor Windows. Thus it is very well suited for cross-compilation. However, Wixl lacks many features compared to WiX. As always, contributions are welcome!
