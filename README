msitools is a set of programs to inspect and build Windows Installer
(.MSI) files.  It is based on libmsi, a portable library to read and
write .MSI files.  libmsi in turn is a port of (and a subset of) Wine's
implementation of the Windows Installer.

msitools plans to be a solution for packaging and deployment of
cross-compiled Windows applications.

While in a very early stage, it is already usable.  Two tools are
provided, msiinfo and msibuild, respectively to inspect and create
MSI files.  They are very low-level, but it should already be possible
to use these tools to take an existing .MSI file, and update it with
new build products (for example after a cross-compilation).

msitools uses libgsf in order to read OLE Structured Storage files
(which are the underlying format of .MSI files).  As of December 7th,
2012 you need to build libgsf from git because a required bugfix is not
found in any release.  Fedora packages for a fixed libgsf can be found
at http://bonzini.fedorapeople.org/.
